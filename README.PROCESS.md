# Project Development Process

## 1. Project Setup

1. Defined basic project requirements.
2. Set up Django project with default settings.
3. Initialized Git repository.

## 2. Database Design

1. Created simple database schema.
2. Made basic Django models for User, Ride, and RideEvent.
3. Added ForeignKey relationships between models.
4. Included essential fields like status for Ride and description for RideEvent.
5. Added some model methods and Meta classes.

## 3. API Development

1. Set up Django Rest Framework for API creation.
2. Created serializers for each model to handle data serialization and deserialization.
3. Developed ViewSets for each model to handle CRUD operations.
4. Implemented custom logic in ViewSets, such as:
   - Filtering and ordering in RideViewSet
   - Creating RideEvents when a Ride is created or updated
   - Adding User details to Ride responses
5. Set up URL routing for the API endpoints.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

1. Implemented token-based authentication using Django Rest Framework's TokenAuthentication.
2. Created custom permission classes to ensure proper access control.

## 5. Additional Features and Optimizations

1. Implemented pagination for list views to improve performance with large datasets.
2. Added custom filtering options, such as filtering rides by status or rider email.
3. Implemented distance calculation for rides using the Haversine formula.
4. Created a custom BaseResponse class for consistent API responses.

## 6. Documentation and Code Improvement

1. Created API documentation with endpoint details and usage instructions.
2. Reviewed code for quality and best practices.
3. Improved code readability and structure where needed.

The development process focused on creating a functional and maintainable ride-sharing API. The project structure allows for future updates and expansions.
