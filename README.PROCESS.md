# Project Development Process

## 1. Project Setup and Initial Planning

1. Defined the project requirements for a ride-sharing application.
2. Set up a new Django project and configured the necessary settings.
3. Created a Git repository for version control.

## 2. Database Design and Model Creation

1. Designed the database schema for the ride-sharing application.
2. Created Django models for User, Ride, and RideEvent in their respective apps.
3. Set up appropriate relationships between models (e.g., ForeignKey relationships).
4. Added necessary fields to each model, such as status for Ride and description for RideEvent.
5. Implemented custom model methods and Meta classes for additional functionality and optimization.

## 3. API Development

1. Set up Django Rest Framework for API creation.
2. Created serializers for each model to handle data serialization and deserialization.
3. Developed ViewSets for each model to handle CRUD operations.
4. Implemented custom logic in ViewSets, such as:
   - Filtering and ordering in RideViewSet
   - Creating RideEvents when a Ride is created or updated
   - Adding User details to Ride responses
5. Set up URL routing for the API endpoints.

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

1. Implemented token-based authentication using Django Rest Framework's TokenAuthentication.
2. Created custom permission classes to ensure proper access control.

## 5. Additional Features and Optimizations

1. Implemented pagination for list views to improve performance with large datasets.
2. Added custom filtering options, such as filtering rides by status or rider email.
3. Implemented distance calculation for rides using the Haversine formula.
4. Created a custom BaseResponse class for consistent API responses.

## 6. Testing and Documentation

1. Wrote unit tests for models, serializers, and views.
2. Created comprehensive API documentation, including endpoint details, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

## 7. Code Review and Refactoring

1. Conducted code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.
2. Refactored code where necessary to improve readability and maintainability.

## 8. Deployment Preparation

1. Set up environment variables for sensitive information.
2. Configured settings for different environments (development, staging, production).
3. Prepared deployment scripts and documentation.

Throughout the development process, I maintained a focus on creating a scalable, maintainable, and well-documented ride-sharing application API. The project structure and code organization were designed to allow for easy expansion and modification in the future.
